# disatapp - Inventory Smart V2.0

This browser based app is used as an inventory management system. 
So obviously the program is ment to be used for keeping track of inventory. 
It was my first attemped built on a custom made MVC architecture in php. 

This project made me realize I need to use a Framework. 
The "Model" files were removed purposely.
